## Design Documentation 
### Design Process
In creating the design for the portfolio, a mood board was created to capture the style colour scheme that would best reflect my professional personality. Although I wanted to showcase my developing skills, I wanted to create my own proffesional mould of where coding and  development can be colourful, creative and glamorous. 

As seen on the mood board, there was a recurring them of pink, fashion and glamour. This was an unintentional design process where I selected images from pinterest that captured my interest with the resulting images summariseing my style. 


### Personal Logo
My logo was a design to relfect my personality. As stated by my sister, the straight typography of the 'M' reflects my professional personality, where it is disciplined and refined. Whereas the typography of the 'B' shows chaotic colour which reflects my creativing thinking, aspirations and passion. 


### Usability Considerations
Due to limitations in the design and time process, usability considerations are limited. A current concern for usuabiltiy is the choice of the secondary font colour, a hue of pink. As pink can be difficult for people to see if they are colourblind, this will effect how they view and receive information from the site. As an alternative, future developments of the portfolio can have a function where more nuetral colours are used to increase accessiblity. 

## Details of planning process




### Project plan and timeline

As a visual planner, I encorporated using third party propierty software to assist in the design process of the webstie. This helped me to visualise what direction I wanted my portfolio to take as well as indicate to me what could be possible to code. 

Although this preliminary design will shape how my portfolio evolves, it did take away time from developing the code myself and affected the timeline for the project. 

Trello was used to breakdown the tasks for the project and to assign what priority items needed to be completed, in order to make the portfolio scalable.
